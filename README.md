# **Interactive Mini-Robot Companion / Pet**
## A Tamagotchi / Furby-inspired Arduino Project  

This project is a mini-robot "companion" designed to simulate the care and interaction experience of a classic virtual pet. Users can interact with the robot by satisfying its needs, playing minigames, and enjoying its quirky behaviors.

> [!CAUTION]
> This README is a work in progress. Updates will be made as the project develops.

## **Introduction**

### **Initial Idea and Inspiration**  
The inspiration for this project came from the popularity of electronic toys like the Tamagotchi (especially in the late '90s) and Furby (popular in the early 2000s).  

### **Usefulness**  
Designing this robot develops practical skills in both hardware (wiring, circuit design, sensor integration) and software engineering (C programming, modular coding, logic implementation). The project is also a fun, creative challenge and can serve as an educational toy for children.

## **Overview**

### **Features**
- **Basic Needs System**:
  - Tracks hunger, happiness, and energy levels.
  - Needs decrease over time and require user interaction.  
- **Minigames**:
  - *(TBD)*
- **Expressive Outputs**:
  - OLED screen displays emotions and statuses.
  - LCD Display for minigames and interaction.
  - Buzzer for sound effects and alerts.  
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - Buttons for feeding, playing, and interacting.
  - Infrared remote control for more complex minigames.
  - Ambient temperature and humidity sensor - keep the bot in a comfortable environment.
  - Proximity sensor for enhanced interaction.
